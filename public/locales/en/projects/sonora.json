  "personalExperience": "Sonora was one of my most technically challenging projects. Working with real-time audio generation, word-level timing, and branching narratives required me to dive deep into audio processing and state management. Integrating with ElevenLabs and OpenAI APIs taught me a lot about working with external services and handling async operations efficiently. The branching story system was particularly interesting to architect, as it required careful consideration of state management and user flow. Building the audio player with timeline controls and subtitle synchronization was a great learning experience in media handling. This project at Binedge allowed me to work on cutting-edge technology and push the boundaries of what I thought was possible with web technologies. The satisfaction of seeing users navigate through interactive stories with AI-generated voices was incredible."

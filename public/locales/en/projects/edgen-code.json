  "personalExperience": "I also worked on an application similar to the previous one (EdgenChat), but this one needed to run as a Visual Studio extension, which I had no experience in doing. After digging through the VS documentation and some open source projects on GitHub, I was able to somewhat understand how to code a working VS extension and produce a working app that fit our purpose.\n\nThis project was particularly challenging because I had to learn the VS Code extension architecture from scratch. Understanding how extensions work, how to create webviews, and how to integrate with the VS Code API was a steep learning curve. However, it was very rewarding to see the extension working within the IDE and providing value to developers."

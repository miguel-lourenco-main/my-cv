  "personalExperience": "Agentic Hub was a fascinating exploration into the future of AI agent marketplaces. Working on this project at Binedge gave me the opportunity to think deeply about how AI agents could interact with each other and with humans. The concept of agent-to-agent hiring was particularly interesting to design, as it required careful consideration of APIs, workflows, and trust mechanisms. Building the marketplace interface with multiple agent categories challenged me to create intuitive navigation and discovery patterns. The embeddable UI components for each agent type required careful design to ensure consistency while allowing for agent-specific customization. This project pushed me to think about composability, API design, and how complex systems can be made accessible through good UX. It was exciting to work on something that felt like it was at the cutting edge of AI application design."

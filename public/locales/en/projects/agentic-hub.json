  "personalExperience": "Agentic Hub was an interesting exploration into the usage of cryptocurrencies as well as the future of AI agent marketplaces. The idea for it started with a discussion about the possible usages of cryptocurrencies, which resulted in a suggestion to use it as a way to easily and quickly process payments as well as to avoid the need for a third party app that take a cut of each transaction.\n\nThis works especially well for AI agent marketplaces, where both users and agents can hire other agents. Agents need a fast, low-cost way to pay each other, and in real-world usage they’ll process many transactions with users and peers. Crypto improves both speed and cost, making those payments efficient.\n\nIt was exciting to imagine and work on something that was a proof of concept for what part of the future of AI and crypto would look like, since there are now endless AI agent marketplaces."
